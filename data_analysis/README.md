#### Descriptions of each notebook:

1. initial_data_analysis.ipynb:
This notebook contains my initial ideas with my data analysis, and it primarily focuses on describing the first dataset that I planned to work with. The linkedin_df is found from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/killbot/linkedin) and has since been renamed to linkedin_original. In this notebook, I examine the dimensions of the data frame, what each row represents, and what the columns mean. I also examine the distribution and clean the data frame, removing unnecessary columns and renaming others. I create a basic visualization (scatter plot) and end with some observations of the data and questions that I'm interested in exploring.

2. data_analysis_assignment_6.ipynb:
In this notebook, I create 5 blocks, each with a question I want to answer. Upon receiving feedback on my initial_data_analysis notebook, I also begin to use another dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/killbot/linkedin-profiles-and-jobs-data) in conjunction with my original dataset. I start by observing and cleaning this new data frame, named linkedin_updated. Then, in my first block, I examine whether there's a gender leadership gap within the data. In my second block, I look at the effects of LinkedIn profile pictures. In the third block, I examine the benefits of LinkedIn's premium membership, and in the fourth block, I investigate thej job-hopping stereotype of millenials. In the last block, I examine whether the proportion of different races working at Fortune 500 companies reflect their overall population proportions.

3. data_analysis_assignment_7.ipynb:
This notebook includes 4 new blocks, each posing a question, which is then analyzed with either the linkedin_original or linkedin_updated data frame. The first block examines the credibility of LinkedIn influencers, analyzing whether their follower count correlates with their work history â€” specifically whether or not they work at a Fortune 500 company. The second block pertains to gender bias in the hiring process by looking at the tenure lengths of women compared to men. The third block examines the differences in positions that young people hold and those held by older, more experienced people. In the last block, I identify the Fortune 500 companies within the data frame that have the highest racial diversity.

4. explanatory_visualizations_assignment_7.ipynb:
This notebook compiles 5 different explanatory visualizations, each of which is compiled from one of the prior 3 notebooks. The first is a scatter plot examining the relationship between beauty and follower count. Then, I include a bar plot comparing premium and regular users and the proportions of each working at well-known companies. I then include a scatter plot with age and position duration, two word clouds built from 2 list of position titles (one for younger people, another for older people), and a bar plot of the 20 most racially diverse Fortune 500 companies.
