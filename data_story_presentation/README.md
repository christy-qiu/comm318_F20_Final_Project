## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

There are 2 items within this folder: my final blog post notebook and another folder containing 12 images that are used within the blog post.

I've chosen to present my data story through a Jupyter notebook, with many descriptive mark-up cells. The blog post contains my own personal narrative, with my experiences of using LinkedIn, along with many interesting facts and statistics, pulled from articles and research studies.

#### The core of the blog post is my 4-part analysis. 
1. The first part pertains to gender equality. In this section, I pose 2 questions. The first examines whether or not a gender leadership gap exists in the data, and the second examines a bias amongst hiring women. 
2. In the second section, I examine 2 race-related questions: Do the proportion of Asians, Whites, and Blacks working at Fortune 500 companies reflect their overall population proportions, and which Fortune 500 companies have the highest racial diversity? 
3. The third part focuses on 2 age-related questions. The first asks whether there's truth to the job-hopping stereotype of millenials, and the second asks about the different types of positions held by people newer to the job market and people who are more experienced. 
4. The fourth and final part relates to some of the features on LinkedIn, and I pose 3 questions. The first examines the effects of including a profile picture on chances of working at a large company. The second investigates whether the helpfulness of the LinkedIn premium membership, and the third question examines the credibility of LinkedIn influencers, using their work history as a proxy.
